The BACE package (<https://github.com/tt-econ/bace>) helps researchers implement and run their own Bayesian Adaptive Choice Experiment (BACE). BACE allows researchers to elicit preferences quickly and efficiently using a dynamic experimental framework.


## Demo

The BACE package provides a BACE application template that will be implemented upon installation together with other helpful tools.
You can then modify the provided BACE application to your specific setting.

Example output from the BACE package template:

- A BACE application hosted directly on AWS: <https://r3ue9e2bf3.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/survey>

You can either use the AWS-hosted BACE application as in the example above, or integrate it with platforms such as Qualtrics and SurveyCTO:
